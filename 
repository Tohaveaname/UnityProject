    Made comments very clear.
    
    I realised that the comments were difficult to follow for other people so I
    rewrote most of them and added quite a few into the various switch
    statements to make it clear above each case what that specific case made
    the script do.

    Removed irrelivant script and changed comments.
    
    Realised BlackBackgroundScript was still attached to the
    NightBackground object so I have removed it and deleted the
    script. Also deleted unnecessary functions that were not
    being used in the scripts.
    
        Tidied up comments in all scripts to make them have uniform
    presentation. Added some comments to make code clearer.

    Unsure of what the conflict was as the code was the same.

    Added second hand gesture.
    
    Added second hand gesture which caused the case numbers for
    each page after page 2 part 3 to be incremented by one.
    
    This effected BookMaster, Caterpillar and Leaf scripts.
    
    This was done rather easily as only the case numbers needed to change.
    
    And BookMaster got an extra case for 2 part 3.

    gesture animation.

    Added some files to the assets folder for organisational purposes.

    is called every frame in Update().
    
    Changed Static Sprite Sun to a .png to see if there was a way in Unity to
    convert a 255, 255, 255 RGB into a 0 alpha but I couldn't find one.

    the non-looping animation.
    
    Added a GameObject called stomachAcheCaterpillar which is needed for one
    of the pages in the book.

    is called in Update() every frame. CaterpillarAction() has cases for pages: 3, 4,
    5, 6, 7, 8, 9 part 1 and 10. These are cases: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12

    Created placeholders up to page 4
    
    Modified Bookmaster to handle all actors and props with
    a new function called HandleScene(). This is a switch statement
    based on which is the current page similar to the HandleText()
    function. Currently handles: moon, egg, brokenEgg, sunStatic,
    sunAnimation, caterpillar, butterfly and all in game text.
    
    Added these GameObjects to the Bookmaster script:
    moon, egg, brokenEgg, sunStatic, sunAnimation, caterpillar,
    butterfly.
    
    Added a static sprite of the sun, so the animation smiling
    animation does not start at the incorrect place.
    
    Added comments to make the switch statement easier to see
    what was happening when.
    
    Added commented out code for the food to the HandleScene()
    switch statement for future use.

    Fixed a problem where the text did not appear.
    
    The Book master script was not working properly as
    all the in the game text was not appearing.
    
    Added the HandleText() function to Update() inside the
    space pressed if statement . Adding it on space press
    prevented the switch statement running every frame.
    Also removed Start Disabled script from page one, as
    this prevented the first paragraph being shown.
